# Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the future directions and plans for the Cloud Native AI Model Format Specification project. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive specification that facilitates seamless integration of AI models with the cloud-native ecosystem.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Model Image Packaging and Distribution

- **Goal**: Define a standardized approach for packaging and distributing AI model images.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop a model image format specification.
  - Create tools and libraries to support the packaging process.
  - Collaborate with the broader CNCF community to gather feedback and ensure alignment with other cloud-native projects.
  - Promote the adoption of the specification through community engagement, presentations, and workshops.

### Phase 2: Community Engagement and Adoption

- **Goal**: Gain attention and support from the broader CNCF community and other relevant projects.
- **Tasks**:
  - Identify key stakeholders and projects within the CNCF community.
  - Establish communication channels and partnerships with these stakeholders.
  - Organize community events, discussion panels, and presentations to showcase the benefits of our specification.
  - Collect feedback and iterate on the specification based on community input.

### Phase 3: Define Runtime Specification

- **Goal**: Create a runtime specification that supports the integration of various inference engines with the cloud-native ecosystem.
- **Tasks**:
  - Research and analyze popular inference engines and their applicability to AI model deployment.
  - Define a set of requirements and features for the runtime specification.
  - Develop a draft runtime specification and share it with the community for feedback.
  - Implement reference implementations and tools to facilitate the adoption of the runtime specification.

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

- **Goal**: Ensure that the model packaging, distribution, and runtime specifications work seamlessly together.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct thorough testing of the model packaging and runtime specifications.
  - Integrate the specifications with popular inference engines and cloud-native platforms.
  - Address any issues or gaps identified during the testing phase.
  - Release stable versions of the specifications and supporting tools.

## Future Directions

- Explore additional features and enhancements based on community feedback and technological advancements.
- Continue to engage with the CNCF community and other relevant projects to promote the adoption and evolution of the specifications.
- Maintain and improve the tools and libraries supporting the specifications.

## Conclusion

We are excited about the future of the Cloud Native AI Model Format Specification project and look forward to collaborating with the community to build a robust and widely adopted standard for AI model deployment in the cloud-native ecosystem.
